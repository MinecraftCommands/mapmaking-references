# Player data

`<player>.dat` files are used by servers to store the state of individual players. The format is also used within level.dat files to store the state of the singleplayer player, which overrides any `<player>.dat` files with the same name as the singleplayer player. These files are in NBT format.

# Item data

Items are used both in the player's inventory and Ender inventory, and in chest [[Chunk format#Block entity format|tile entities]], dropped item entities, furnace tile entities, brewing stand tile entities, and Villager trading recipes. Sometimes a Slot tag is used to specify the slot the item is in, such as with chests; other times there is no Slot tag, such as with dropped items.

:file_folder: The item's root tag. Some instances may give this tag a name, other times it is nameless because it is in a list.
* :one: **Count**: Number of [[item]]s stacked in this inventory slot. Any item can be stacked, including tools, armor, and vehicles. Range is -128 to 127. Values of 1 are not displayed in-game. Values below 1 are displayed in red.<ref group=note>A value of zero means the item will disappear when you try to use or drop it, but it can still be crafted with, or fired in the case of [[arrow]]s, as though it were a stack of 1.

A negative value is similar except that the item can be used by right-clicking, can be used until it wears out if it is a tool or bow (but will break if you use it as a melee weapon). This can let the count go below -128, but it will wrap around (by adding the nearest multiple of 256) when the server restarts or the single-player game is saved and reopened. The same applies if two negative stacks are combined. If Q is pressed while holding a negative stack, it will drop all at once and appear as a normal dropped item, but it will be impossible to pick up.

A stack of more than 64 may decrease if moved to or from a container, or the mouse pointer may drop only as many as normally fill a stack and continue to hold the remainder. A stack of ''N'' damaged tools used until "they" break will become ''N'' â€“ 1 ''intact'' tools, but if the stack is split then both tools keep their damage.</ref>
* :one: **Slot**: May not exist. The inventory slot the item is in.
* :three: **Damage**: The data value for this item. The name "Damage" comes from when only tools used this value, now many other items use this value for other purposes. For blocks, it is the 4-bit "block data" tag that determines a variant of the block. Defaults to 0.{{upcoming**until=1.13**
* :capital_abcd: **id**: [[Data values|Item/Block ID]] (This is a Short tag prior to 1.8.) If not specified, Minecraft changes the item to [[stone]] (setting ID to 1 and Damage to 0, and ignoring any existing Damage value) when loading the chunk or summoning the item .<!-- Tested using NBTExplorer in 1.8.2-pre1 -->
* :file_folder: **tag**: Additional information about the item, discussed in the below sections. This tag is optional for most items.

## General Tags

Items with durability can be made unbreakable and will never lose any durability. Additionally, items can have specifications for Adventure mode to describe which blocks may be broken with them.

:file_folder: **tag**: The `tag` tag.
* :seven: **Damage**: The damage value for this item. Defaults to 0. {{upcoming**ver=1.13**
* :one: **Unbreakable**: 1 or 0 (true/false) - if true, the item doesn't lose durability when used.
* :page_with_curl: **CanDestroy**: The only blocks this item may break when used by a player in [[adventure]] mode.
* * :capital_abcd:: The block ID.

## Block Tags

Blocks can be given tags to specify what blocks they may be placed against in Adventure mode, and to specify what Tile Entity NBT tags to apply to them when placed.

:file_folder: **tag**: The `tag` tag.
* :page_with_curl: **CanPlaceOn**: Determines which blocks that blocks with this tag can be placed against in [[adventure]] mode.
* * :capital_abcd:: The block ID.
* :file_folder: **BlockEntityTag**: [[Block entity]] NBT tags which are applied when this block is placed.<ref>Assuming the block is of a type that creates a block entity at all. If not, BlockEntityTag has no effect.</ref> Used to store data on [[banner]]s and [[shield]]s or on blocks obtained in [[creative]] by holding {{key**ctrl** (or {{key**cmd** on mac) and pressing {{control**pick block** on a block containing a block entity.
* * See [[Chunk format#Block entity format|Tile Entity Format]]. Excludes x, y, z, and id tags.

## Enchantments

There are two ways enchantments are associated with items; the first way is that the item is actually enchanted and the enchantment affects the behavior of the item, and the second way is that the item is an [[enchanted book]] which simply stores the enchantments without actually affecting the behavior of the item. There is also the `RepairCost` tag which tracks [[anvil]] usage for items, making them more costly with every use of the anvil.

:file_folder: **tag**: The `tag` tag.
* :page_with_curl: **ench**: Contains [[enchantment]]s on this item that affect the way the item works.
* * :file_folder:: A single enchantment.
* * * :three: **id**: ID of the enchantment.
* * * :three: **lvl**: Level of the enchantment, where 1 is level 1.
* :page_with_curl: **StoredEnchantments**: Contains enchantments for [[enchanted book]]s.
* * :file_folder:: A stored enchantment, identical structure to each enchantment in `ench`.
* :seven: **RepairCost**: Number of enchantment levels to add to the base level cost when repairing, combining, or renaming this item with an [[Anvil]].
`StoredEnchantments` tooltips will not be displayed if edited onto an item other than an enchanted book. Enchantments stored in `ench`, however, will always be displayed in the tooltip and will cause the item to glow, even if they cannot have any effect.

## Attribute Modifiers

All items can be given [[Attribute#Modifiers|Modifiers]] which affect various [[Attribute]]s of the player/mob which wears or holds them. Note that if an item has vanilla default AttributeModifiers, these will cease to exist if this tag is added (e.g. a Diamond Sword given an empty AttributeModifiers list will no longer provide a boost to damage). Also note that the default vanilla AttributeModifiers do not actually use this tag, and as such, it will not appear on a natural item.

:file_folder: **tag**: The `tag` tag.
* :page_with_curl: **AttributeModifiers**: Contains Attribute Modifiers on this item which modify Attributes of the wearer or holder (if the item is not in the hand or armor slots, it will have no effect).

* * * :capital_abcd: **AttributeName**: The name of the Attribute this Modifier is to act upon.
* * * :capital_abcd: **Name**: Name of the Modifier
* * * :capital_abcd: **Slot**: Slot the item must be in for the modifier to take effect. "mainhand", "offhand", "feet", "legs", "chest", or "head".

* * * :keycap_ten: **UUIDMost**: Uppermost bits of the modifier's UUID.
* * * :keycap_ten: **UUIDLeast**: Lowermost bits of the modifier's UUID.

## Potion Effects

[[Potion]]s, [[splash potion]]s, [[lingering potion]]s and [[tipped arrow]]s can have multiple, customized effects via the CustomPotionEffects tag. These effects are added to the default effect under the Potion tag if present. In addition the color can be overridden with the CustomPotionColor tag.

:file_folder: **tag**: The `tag` tag.
* :page_with_curl: **CustomPotionEffects**: The custom [[Potion effects]] this potion has.
* * :file_folder: One of these for each effect.

* * * :seven: **Duration**: The duration of the effect in [[tick]]s.
* * * :one: **Ambient**: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen. This tag is optional and defaults to 0. Due to a bug, it has no effect on splash potions.
* * * :one: **ShowParticles**: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles. This tag is optional and defaults to 1. Due to a bug, it has no effect on splash potions.
* :capital_abcd: **Potion**: The name of the default [[Potion#Item data|potion effect]]. This name differs from the potion effect name. For example, the value for an "Instant Health II" potion is "minecraft:strong_healing".

:file_folder: **tag**: The `tag` tag.
* :file_folder: **display**: Display properties.
* * :seven: **color**: The color of the leather armor. The tooltip will display "Dyed" if advanced tooltips are disabled or will otherwise display the hexadecimal color value.

For example, setting to 3 would hide both "ench" and "AttributeModifiers" tags, and setting to 63 would hide everything.

## Written Books

Both [[book and quill]] and [[written book]] use the `tag` tag to store information about the book. Only written books store the `title`, `author`, and `generation` of the book; `pages` is stored in both varieties.

{{:Written Book/DV
